## Toolkits and Open-source libraries
[IBM's AI Fairness 360](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/) (most comprehensive to date)
Most comprehensive AI Fairness toolkit to date.

### Bias Detection
[Fairness Measures](http://www.fairness-measures.org/)
Fairness benchmarking tool for machine learning â€“ provides several fairness metrics like difference of means, disparate impact and odds ratio, along with datasets though some are not in the public domain.

[FairML](https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml)
Auditing tool for blackbox predictive models by quantifying the relative effects of various input on the model's predictions

[Fairtest](https://github.com/columbia/fairtest)
Checks for associations between predicted labels and protected attributes. Provides a way to identify regions of the input space where an algorithm might incur unusually high errors. Also includes a catalog of many datasets.

[Aequitas](https://dsapp.uchicago.edu/projects/aequitas/) (*not for commerical use*)
Friendly for both data scientists and policymakers, with a Python library and a website to upload data for bias analysis. Several fairness maetrics (demographic, statistical parity, disparate impact etc.) and a "fairness tree" to help users identify the correct metric to use for their particular situation.
